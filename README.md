This project implements the A (A-star) algorithm* to find the shortest path on a map. The algorithm is visualized using C++ and graphics, providing a clear and interactive demonstration of pathfinding in a grid-based environment. The user can see the algorithm in action as it calculates the optimal route between a start and end point, taking into account obstacles in the map.
